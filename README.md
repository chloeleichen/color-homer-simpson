Let's Color Homer Simpson !
=========


The is a lightweight javascript plugin that allow you to color Homer Simpson by dragging and dropping color onto him. You can also color text and html containers. 

You can print your work when you are finished. 

<strong>[Try it here](http://chloechen.io/color-homer-simpson/)</strong>


It works by simply adding class "paint-area" into the html, then the container becomes colorable. 

To color svg, add class "paint-area--svg" in addition to "paint-area". 
To color text, add class "paint-area--text"
in addition to "paint-area".
